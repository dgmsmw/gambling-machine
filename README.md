## Gambling Machine Project

This project is a simple gambling machine simulation written in Python. It was created as part of my GCSE Computer Science work experience.

### What does it do?
The program lets you play a virtual gambling game. You can place bets, spin the machine, and see if you win or lose. The game keeps track of your balance and gives feedback after each round.

### How to run the program
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project folder.
4. Run the following command:
   ```
   python gamblingMachine.py
   ```

### Features
- Simple text-based interface
- Random outcomes for each spin
- Balance tracking
- Input validation

### Why I made this
I built this project to learn about:
- Python programming basics
- Using random numbers
- Handling user input
- Writing clear and maintainable code

### How it works
The program uses Python's `random` module to simulate the gambling machine. You enter your bet, spin, and the program tells you if you won or lost. Your balance updates after each round.
